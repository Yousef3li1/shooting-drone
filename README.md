# ü§ñ Shooting Drone with Face Detection and Robotic Arm üéØ

## üåü Overview

The **Shooting Drone with Face Detection** project combines face recognition with a shooting drone. The drone uses a camera to detect a person, and based on the detection, the robotic arm is aimed at the person and fires a laser (or projectile). This project uses Raspberry Pi and OpenCV for real-time face recognition, integrated with a robotic arm for targeting and shooting.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Face Detection**: Uses a camera and OpenCV to detect faces in real-time.
- **Robotic Arm Integration**: The robotic arm moves to target the detected face.
- **Laser Shooting Mechanism**: Once the target is locked, the laser or shooting mechanism is activated.
- **Autonomous Flight and Control**: The drone can fly autonomously or be manually controlled.

## üõ† Components

The following components are necessary to build the **Shooting Drone with Face Detection**:

- **PiCamera**: For capturing video feed and detecting faces.
- **Face Recognition**: Python library for detecting and recognizing faces.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as the main controller for the drone and robotic arm.
- **Robotic Arm**: For moving and aiming the laser or shooting mechanism.
- **Laser or Projectile Shooter**: Mechanism to fire at the detected target.
- **Flight Controller**: For controlling the drone's movements (e.g., Naza Lite, Pixhawk).
- **Brushless Motors**: To provide flight propulsion.
- **GPS and Sensors**: For navigation and positioning.
- **Battery**: Provides power for the drone and components.
- **Wireless Control**: RC transmitter/receiver for manual control of the drone.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

1. **Assemble the Drone Frame**  
   Choose your frame (quad, hexacopter, etc.) and assemble the drone with motors and propellers.

2. **Install PiCamera and Setup Raspberry Pi**  
   Connect the PiCamera to the Raspberry Pi and install OpenCV and face_recognition libraries.

   ## üöÄ Usage

Once everything is installed and configured:

- **Start Face Detection: The drone‚Äôs camera will start detecting faces in real-time.
- **Face Recognition: The robotic arm will automatically adjust to point at the detected face.
- **Activate Shooting: Once the face is locked in, the laser or shooting mechanism will be triggered to aim and fire at the target.
